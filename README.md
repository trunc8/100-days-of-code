# 100-days-of-code

### Day 1 (18-Jun-22)
- 1_Two Sum
- 208_Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)


### Day 2 (19-Jun-22)
- 745_Prefix and Suffix Search
    + [Trie with multiple parameters](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70726224/7589046)
    + [09:22 hrs] Have been using naked pointers a lot for #208 and #745. Very unclean code too
- 2_Add Two Numbers


### Day 3 (20-Jun-22)
- 208_Implement Trie (Prefix Tree): Different solution


### Day 4 (21-Jun-22)
- 2_Add Two Numbers: Different solution
- 700_Search in a Binary Search Tree
- 701_Insert into a Binary Search Tree


### Day 4 (22-Jun-22)
- 1642_Furthest Building You Can Reach: Didn't finish


### Day 5 (23-Jun-22)
- 215_Kth Largest Element in an Array
    + Comment: Didn't actually solve this. Just used STL function `std::sort()`
    + Will try to solve it again without using non-trivial STL functions


### Day 6 (24-Jun-22)
- 703_Kth Largest Element in a Stream
    + [CMU resource: Priority Queues and Heaps](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/121/notes/heaps.html) Self-implemented binary heap
    + Added another solution using priority_queue stl
- 1642_Furthest Building You Can Reach: Didn't finish


### Day 7 (25-Jun-22)
- 1642_Furthest Building You Can Reach
    + Finally solved this!!
- 665_Non-decreasing Array
- 215_Kth Largest Element in an Array
    + Solution 2: Solved using `priority_queue`
