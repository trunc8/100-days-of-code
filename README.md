# 100-days-of-code

#### Day 1 (18-Jun-22)
- [#1][]: Two Sum
- [#208][]: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)


#### Day 2 (19-Jun-22)
- [#745][]: Prefix and Suffix Search
    + [Trie with multiple parameters](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70726224/7589046)
    + @09:22 hrs Have been using naked pointers a lot for [#208][] and [#745][]. Very unclean code too
- [#2][]: Add Two Numbers


#### Day 3 (20-Jun-22)
- [#208][]: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree): Different solution


#### Day 4 (21-Jun-22)
- [#2][]: Add Two Numbers: Different solution
- [#700][]: Search in a Binary Search Tree
- [#701][]: Insert into a Binary Search Tree


#### Day 4 (22-Jun-22)
- [#1642][]: Furthest Building You Can Reach: Didn't finish


#### Day 5 (23-Jun-22)
- [#215][]: Kth Largest Element in an Array
    + Comment: Didn't actually solve this. Just used STL function `std::sort()`
    + Will try to solve it again without using non-trivial STL functions


#### Day 6 (24-Jun-22)
- [#703][]: Kth Largest Element in a Stream
    + [CMU resource: Priority Queues and Heaps](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/121/notes/heaps.html) Self-implemented binary heap
    + Added another solution using priority_queue stl
- [#1642][]: Furthest Building You Can Reach: Didn't finish


#### Day 7 (25-Jun-22)
- [#215][]: Kth Largest Element in an Array
    + Solution 2: Solved using `priority_queue`
- [#1642][]: Furthest Building You Can Reach
    + Finally solved this!! Used [#215][]
- [#665][]: Non-decreasing Array


#### Day 8 (26-Jun-22)
- [#217][]: Contains Duplicate
- [#125][]: Valid Palindrome
- [#1423][]: Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
    + Feel pretty rusty with both the solutions I wrote
    + Replaced soln 2. Feel more confident of testcase coverage with this soln 2.
- [#121][]: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock


#### Day 9 (27-Jun-22)
- [#1689][]: Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers

#### Day 10 (28-Jun-22)
- [#1647][]: Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique
